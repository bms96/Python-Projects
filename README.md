# CMIS-102: Introduction to Problem Solving and Algorithm Design with Python

This repository contains all of the projects/assignments that I have worked on during this class:

**Assignment 1:**

The first assignment involves writing a Python program to compute the weekly pay for a salesman. Your program should prompt the user for the number of hours worked for that week and the weekly sales. Your program should compute the total pay as the sum of the pay based on the number of hours worked times the hourly rate plus the commission. You should chose a value for the hourly pay. The commission should be computed as a percentage of the weekly sales. You should choose a value for the percentage. Your program should output the pay based on the hours worked, the commission and the total pay for the week.

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments.  Document the values you chose for the hourly rate and commission percentage in your comments as well.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test report in a Word document or a .pdf file. 15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode and define the values of your constants, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report.

**Assignment 2:**

The second assignment involves writing a Python program to compute the price of a theater ticket. Your program should prompt the user for the patron's age and whether the movie is 3D. Children and seniors should receive a discounted price. There should be a surcharge for movies that are 3D. You should decide on the age cutoffs for children and seniors and the prices for the three different age groups. You should also decide on the amount of the surcharge for 3D movies. Your program should output the ticket price for the movie ticket based on the age entered and whether the movie is in 3D.

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments. Document the values you chose for the age cutoffs for children and seniors, the prices for the three different age groups and the surcharge for 3D movies in your comments as well.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test report in a Word document or a .pdf file.  15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode and define the values of your constants, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report.

**Assignment 3:**

The third assignment involves writing a Python program to compute the cost of carpeting a room. Your program should prompt the user for the width and height in feet of the room and the quality of carpet to be used. A choice between three grades of carpeting should be given. You should decide on the price per square foot of the three grades on carpet. Your program must include a function that accepts the height, width, and carpet quality as parameters and returns the cost of carpeting that room. After calling that function, your program should then output the carpeting cost.

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments. Document the values you chose for the prices per square foot of the three grades of carpet in your comments as well.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test plan in a Word document or a .pdf file. 15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode and define the values of your constants, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report.

**Assignment 4:**

The fourth assignment involves writing a Python program to compute the average quiz grade for a group of five students. Your program should include a list of five names. Using a for loop, it should successively prompt the user for the quiz grade for each of the five students. Each prompt should include the name of the student whose quiz grade is to be input. It should compute and display the average of those five grades and the highest grade. You should decide on the names of the five students.

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test plan in a Word document or a .pdf file. 15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report.

**Assignment 5:**

The fifth assignment involves writing a Python program to determine whether a password meets all the requirements for a secure password. Your program should prompt the user for the candidate password and output either that the password is valid or the reason it is invalid. To be valid the length of the password must greater than some minimum length but less than some maximum. It must not include the substring "umgc" in any combination of upper or lower case letters. Finally, it must contain the # symbol is some position other than the first or last character. You should decide on the minimum and maximum allowable lengths.

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments. Document the values you chose for the minimum and maximum allowable lengths in your comments as well.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test plan in a Word document or a .pdf file. 15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode and define the values of your constants, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report.

**Assignment 6:**

The sixth assignment involves writing a Python program to read in the temperatures for ten consecutive days in Celsius and store them into an array. The entire array should then be displayed. Next each temperature in the array should be converted to Fahrenheit and the entire array should be again be displayed. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is °F = (°C × 1.8) + 32. Finally, the number of cool, warm and hot days should be counted and the number of each type of days should be displayed. You should decide on the thresholds for determining whether a day is cool, warm or hot..

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments. Document the values you chose for the thresholds in your comments as well.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test plan in a Word document or a .pdf file. 15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode and define the values of your constants, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report.

**Final Project:**

The final project involves writing a Python program to determine the body-mass index of a collection of six individuals. Your program should include a list of six names. Using a for loop, it should successively prompt the user for the height in inches and weight in pounds of each individual. Each prompt should include the name of the individual whose height and weight is to be input. It should call a function that accepts the height and weight as parameters and returns the body mass index for that individual using the formula weight × 703 / height2. That body mass index should then be appended to an array. Using a second loop it should traverse the array of body mass indices and call another function that accepts the body mass index as a parameter and returns whether the individual is underweight, normal weight or overweight. The number of individuals in each category should be counted and the number in each of those categories should be displayed. You should decide on the names of the six individuals and the thresholds used for categorization.

Your program should include the pseudocode used for your design in the comments. Document the thresholds you chose for under weight and over weight in your comments as well.

You are to submit your Python program as a text file (.txt) file. In addition, you are also to submit a test plan in a Word document or a .pdf file. 15% of your grade will be based on whether the comments in your program include the pseudocode and define the values of your constants, 70% on whether your program executes correctly on all test cases and 15% on the completeness of your test report
